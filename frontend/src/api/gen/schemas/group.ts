/**
 * A group is a power set of roles and has a partial order relation defined on it.
This allows for easy permissions testing, e.g. to ensure that a resource is only accessed
by a user that either is an event admin, event mentor, event sidequest master, or event stakeholder,
we can simply write `user_groups >= Group::EventStaff`.

Here is the corresponding Hasse diagram for the group:

```graphviz
graph {
  layout = dot
  rankdir = TB
  node [ shape="none" ]

    EventAdmin [label="EventAdmin"]
    EventMentor [label="EventMentor"]
    EventParticipant [label="EventParticipant"]
    EventSidequestMaster [label="EventSidequestMaster"]
    EventStakeholder [label="EventStakeholder"]
    TeamMember [label="TeamMember"]
    TeamMentor [label="TeamMentor"]
    EventStaff [label="EventStaff"]
    TeamAffiliate [label="TeamAffiliate"]
    EventAffiliate [label="EventAffiliate"]
    ExpertRater [label="ExpertRater"]
    EventGuest [label="EventGuest"]

    { rank=same; EventSidequestMaster, EventStakeholder, EventMentor }

    EventAdmin -- {EventStakeholder, TeamMentor, TeamMember, EventSidequestMaster}
    ExpertRater -- {EventStaff}
    {TeamMember, TeamMentor} -- TeamAffiliate
    TeamMentor -- EventMentor
    {EventMentor, EventStakeholder} -- ExpertRater
    EventSidequestMaster -- EventStaff
    TeamAffiliate -- EventAffiliate
    {EventParticipant, EventStaff} -- EventAffiliate
    TeamMember -- EventParticipant
    EventAffiliate -- EventGuest
}
```
