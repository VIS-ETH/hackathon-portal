## Who are you and what do you do?

Ergon is a Swiss leader in leveraging digitalisation to create unique client
benefits – from the initial idea right through to market success. 

Our highly-qualified experts develop user-friendly, custom software as well as
proven, off-the-shelf products that are deployed worldwide by clients in
a variety of sectors. To design ‘smart’ solutions that meet complex
requirements, we combine a wide range of technological, security, design and
business skills.

## What plans does Ergon have for the future?

Our mission is to empower smart people with smart software. We achieve this in
four ways:

**1.** Create, as a trusted partner, sustainable, competitive technology
advantage for ambitious clients that wish to chart their own future.

**2.** Develop Switzerland’s most user-friendly solutions as well as proven
products deployed worldwide, driving innovation in society.

**3.** Continuously evolve, learning quickly and actively, seeking new
knowledge to excel and inspire with our expertise. We invest in the next
generation and accompany them on their way into the future.

**4.** Keep sustainability in mind. We make decisions that pursue long-term
business goals - for employees, customers and partners.

## Why do you support VIScon?

Interacting with the next generation, nurturing new talent, learning from them
and sharing our own knowledge – that's what we care about. And VIScon gives us
the opportunity to achieve these goals.

We had the privilege of supporting the VIScon event over the past years as one
of the event’s main sponsors. We are convinced that it provides significant
added value as well as in-depth insight into a wide range of topics and
practical techniques. 

Ergon has committed to shaping a successful tomorrow for the next generation
– and that’s exactly what we are doing. We are keen to share our experience
with you, whether on technical or entrepreneurial matters, and to answer any
questions you may have about working life. We look forward to comparing notes
at a successful VIScon 2024.

## What is especially valued within Ergon? What makes you, you?

Our culture and value orientation are the soul of the organisation, and set us
apart. We are convinced that the Ergon culture and community are essential
drivers of our business, and have a positive impact on society.

The Ergon culture means working with like-minded people. We are united by
a passion for doing the right thing together. We foster an environment where
everyone can contribute their best.

Our organisation cultivates motivated and entrepreneurial subject-matter
experts. We believe that satisfied employees turn customers into satisfied
customers. And we share successes. Employees help shape Ergon's future and are
deeply involved in decision-making.

We have won a number of awards for our corporate culture, our commitment to
supporting future generations and our core business of software development. In
2021 we were recognised for the third time, following recognition in 2012 and
2018, as the best employer in Switzerland.
