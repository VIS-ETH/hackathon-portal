## Who are you and what do you do?

We are a team of skilled engineers who are passionate about making the world
a more secure place.

As experts in web application and API protection, we create innovative security
solutions to safeguard both organisations and individuals against current and
future web attacks in an increasingly digitalised world.

We develop market-leading, off-the-shelf products in cloud security,
application security, API security, identity management and access control that
are used by international banks, insurance companies, the public sector and
industry.

We use technologies such as machine learning to stay one step ahead of the
hackers. However, the digital world has to be more than just secure; it must
also meet the highest standards of user-friendliness, efficiency, availability
and time-to-market. That is why we collaborate across disciplines to create the
best possible products, ensuring that our solutions are and remain at the
forefront of cybersecurity innovation.

## What plans does Airlock have for the future?

Our aim is to make the world more secure by addressing the ever-evolving IT
security threats that enterprises face in the modern world.

In the fast-paced digital landscape, protecting against data breaches,
application hacking and threats to organisations’ digital infrastructure is
critical. The repercussions of a successful attack can be profound, impacting
a company’s reputation and carrying substantial legal and financial
consequences. Airlock addresses these challenges head-on with advanced security
solutions that provide robust protection against evolving risks.

We are committed to staying ahead of future security challenges through
continuous innovation and proactive security measures. Our goal is to be
a driving force in innovation, to maintain the highest security standards and
to empower organisations to navigate the digital landscape with both confidence
and resilience.

## Why do you support VIScon?

At Airlock, staying ahead of hackers is what drives our passion to protect
data, applications and identities.

However, our commitment extends beyond mere IT security. As the provider of an
internationally successful IT security product, we are passionate about
fostering enthusiasm for security across all disciplines and in all its forms,
especially among the next generation of IT specialists.

We have had the privilege in recent years of supporting VIScon as one of the
event’s main sponsors. We firmly believe that VIScon offers significant added
value by providing in-depth insights into a wide array of topics and practical
techniques in IT security.

We look forward to talking to you at VIScon 2024 and discussing how we can
improve IT security together.
