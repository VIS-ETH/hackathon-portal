Our goal is to empower our customers with the freedom to use data to its
greatest potential — the freedom to innovate, the freedom to thrive, the

## Why do you support VIScon?

We want to support young talents to use their knowledge, to develop new things
and to learn from each other. We are convinced that VIScon enables this
transfer of knowledge and that all participants can benefit from it.

We also want to actively support the event and will be present with a booth
where our experts will offer insights into the latest technologies and with
tech talks to share this expert knowledge with all participants.

We are looking forward to seeing you!

## What is especially valued within Leica Geosystems? What makes you... you?

Independence and innovation are very important to us. We give our employees
a lot of freedom that they can shape individually, but we also expect them to
take personal responsibility. Innovation is our driver.
