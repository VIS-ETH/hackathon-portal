## Who is Zühlke and what do you do?

Zühlke is a global innovation service provider. We empower ideas and create new business models by developing services and products based on new technologies – from initial vision through development, deployment, production, and beyond.

We specialise in strategy and business innovation, digital solutions and applications, and device and systems engineering. Our solutions provide unique business value and a reliable foundation for ongoing success.

Zühlke was founded in Switzerland in 1968 and is owned by its partners. Our 1,900 employees are based in Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Hong Kong, Portugal, Serbia, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam, serving clients from a wide range of industries. Meanwhile, our venture capital arm Zühlke Ventures provides start-up financing in the high-tech sector.

## Why do you support VIScon?

VIScon is a great opportunity for us to give an insight into certain topics that we are really interested in. Our speakers are people that are deeply involved in the subject and are excited to share their knowledge. It gives more room for discussion than a regular fair as we can exchange with students that are genuinely interested in the presented topics.

## What plans does Zühlke have for the future?

1. We want to keep up with the future IT trends and for this purpose, we encourage our employees to continuously learn (there are working hours dedicated for further education). This way, self-growth is not limited, and we can provide our clients with the best possible support.

2. Sustainability is also a big concern for us. We seek to achieve a net-zero impact on climate. To reach this goal, we first must be aware of our impact.Therefore, this year we will measure our carbon footprint, set targets for CO2 reduction, start reducing emissions starting with the areas of highest impact and offset the remaining emissions with independently verified compensation projects. Since we have the biggest impact through our work with clients, our main goal is to offer services targeting sustainability.

3. We value a healthy workplace and always listen to the needs of our employees so that we can offer them the best possible working conditions. This is an ongoing process, and we will continue to strive for improvement.

## What is especially valued within Zühlke?

Our corporate culture values helping our clients in achieving the greatest possible success. Moreover, training and education on an ongoing basis is extremely important to us which is why we encourage it internally (through courses and training camps) and externally (at seminars and conferences). Ethics, impartiality, and trust are are among the many behaviours we promote at Zühlke.
